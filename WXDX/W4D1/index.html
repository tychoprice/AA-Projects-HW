    <h2> The Secret: </h2>
    <ul>
      <h3> Get Naked (Mentally) </h3>
        <p> All the prior knowledge about algorithms you learned from those really engaging lectures - you must now shove up your ass. Save that stuff to shit on the job interviews. For PP, you don't need to constantly compare your dick size with your partner's. Instead, girth up your teachings skills and make sure both of you are on the same page. You'll never win a three-legged race even if I can see your boner from India.</p>
      <h3> It's Okay to be Gay </h3>
        <p> Every once in a while, make sure to compliment your partner to boost his/her confidence. Chances are they are acting timid because they've heard of your genius. This might sound harder than it actually is but don't worry, it's not. Here is a classic scenario:</p><p>"Wow, I never would have thought of my_arr as a variable name for our result array. That's awesome." </p><p>"Thanks."</p><p>While your partner is creaming himself from your comment, you can take this chance to be more aggressive with your driving or navigating. You've now amortized the PP process with your strategy, nice.
